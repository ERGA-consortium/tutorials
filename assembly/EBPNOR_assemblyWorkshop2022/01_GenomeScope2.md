# GenomeScope2 tutorial

When creating de novo assemblies, there are a lot of considerations to take into account. What is the ploidy of the organism that you are assembling? What is the size of the genome? And what is the heterozygosity rate and repeat content? All these parameters, and more, can be determined by running **GenomeScope2**. For this tutorial we will be running the code below, but for more information about the software, you can click [*here*.](https://github.com/tbenavi1/genomescope2.0) 

## Creating a k-mer profile plot

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=genomescope
#SBATCH --account=ec146
#SBATCH --time=1:0:0
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=5

eval "$(/fp/projects01/ec146/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)" 

conda activate smudgescope

k=21
ploidy=2

mkdir -p tmp
echo $1 > FILES
[ -s reads.kmc_suf ] || kmc -k$k -t10 -m38 -ci1 -cs10000 @FILES reads tmp/

[ -s reads.histo ] ||Â kmc_tools transform reads histogram reads.histo -cx10000

genomescope2 -i reads.histo -o output_ploidy1 -k $k -p 1 1> genomescope_ploidy1.out 2> genomescope_ploidy1.err
genomescope2 -i reads.histo -o output_ploidy2 -k $k -p 2 1> genomescope_ploidy2.out 2> genomescope_ploidy2.err
genomescope2 -i reads.histo -o output_ploidy4 -k $k -p 4 1> genomescope_ploidy4.out 2> genomescope_ploidy4.err

```

We have set up this script for you. What you need to do is to create a `run.sh` in your working folder (`/projects/ec146/work/<username>/genomescope`) with this content (with nano for instance):

```
sbatch /projects/ec146/scripts/run_genomescope.sh /fp/projects01/ec146/data/genomic_data/pacbio/gsMetZobe_pacbio.fastq.gz
````

When you have done this, you can submit to the cluster by typing `sh run.sh`.

This should finish in a handful of minutes (when testing it ran for 2 minutes). You can monitor the progress with `squeue -u <username>`.


## Interpreting your k-mer profile plot

A typical k-mer profile plot will look like this (this is the k-mer profile plot for the river lamprey (*Lampetra fluviatilis*) from EBP-Nor): 

![genomescope_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110542053/206213929-8a46e185-2f85-40e0-8331-ba090d3b0c3e.png)

The peak on the extreme left are all the kmers that are the result of sequencing errors. The largest peak to the right indicates the homozygous parts of the genomes that account for identical k-mers between the two haplotypes. The smaller peak to the left are the heterozygous kmers, that differentiate the two haplotypes.

What have you learned about your reads from the k-mer profile plot you created? To look at the plots you created, open a new terminal window, and navigate to a directory where you want to place your files. When you have found the place where you want to save them, use this code to copy them to your local computer:

```
scp -r <username>@fox.educloud.no:/projects/ec146/work/<username>/genomescope/output_ploidy2/"*.png" .
```

What is the estimated genome size of *Metschnikowia zobellii*?
